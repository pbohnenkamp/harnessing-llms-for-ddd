Domain storytelling activity elements also have a target property that is the identity of the work object or actor the activity is targeted to
Domain storytelling activity elements also can have a number property that orders the activities in the story from first (lowest number) to last (highest number)
Domain storytelling activity elements that do not have a number are prepositions that relate the work objects of an activity to another actor that receives that work item
Domain storytelling work object elements are characterized by elements with type: domainStory:workObject$description
The description part of the work object elements type further characterize the type of the work object
Domain storytelling work object elements also have a name property that is the specific name of the work object
Domain storytelling work object elements also have an id property that uniquely identifies the work object
Domain storytelling actor elements are characterized by elements with type: domainStory:actor$description
The description part of the actor elements type further characterize the type of the actor
Domain storytelling actor elements also have a name property that is the specific name of the actor
Domain storytelling actor elements also have an id property that uniquely identifies the actor

Domain storytelling text annotation elements also have a text property that contains the text of the annotation
Domain storytelling text annotation elements also have an id property that uniquely identifies the text annotation
Domain storytelling text annotation elements are connected to other elements by elements with type: domainStory:connection
Domain storytelling connection elements also have an id property that uniquely identifies the connection
Domain storytelling connection elements also have a source property that is the identity of the element the text annotation annotates
Domain storytelling connection elements also have a target property that is the identity of the text annotation element providing the annotation

Using the EventStorming session data and the domain storytelling data, determine key words that should become part of the team's ubiquitous language when we are discussing the domain and coding the requirements. Put these keywords into a dictionary format, in alphabetical order, with a concise definition, and format the output as raw markdown code.
